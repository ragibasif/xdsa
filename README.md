# xdsa

XDSA contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C.

It's written in standard C (C99) and uses GNU Make for building. The goal of this project is to implement data structures and algorithms from scratch for ***educational purposes only***.

- [x] Dynamic Array
- [ ] Singly Linked List
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] AVL Tree
