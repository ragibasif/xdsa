# Makefile rules:
#     TARGET ... : PREREQUISITE ...
#     <tab char> RECIPE
#
# TARGET - name of generated file(s) (executable or object)
# PREREQUISITE - input file(s) needed to create the TARGET
# RECIPE - command(s) that generate the TARGET
# <tab char> - all indentations are made by tabs not spaces
#
# Make is recursive, if one PREREQUISITE changes, the RECIPE is rerun to generate a new TARGET
#
# To execute make commands:
# make - runs the first TARGET in the Makefile
# make TARGET - to run a specific TARGET rule


# Variables:
#     VAR = value
# or
#     VAR := value
#
# "=" - recursively expanded variables (The expression is not evaluated until the variable is actually used)
# ":=" - simply expanded variables (the expression is evaluated as soon as it is assigned)
#
# Can use variables by:
#    $(VAR)  or ${VAR}
#
# leading spaces are ignored but trailing spaces are not
# compilation flags
# Make has implicit variables with predefined rules, but you can override them
# CC        Program for compiling C programs; default ‘cc’.
# CXX       Program for compiling C++ programs; default ‘g++’.
# CPP       Program for running the C preprocessor, with results to standard
#               output; default ‘$(CC) -E’.
# CFLAGS    Extra flags to give to the C compiler.
# CXXFLAGS  Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler.
# LDFLAGS   Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke
#               the linker, ‘ld’.
# RM        Command to remove a file; default ‘rm -f’. (-f means "force" )
#
# Some are defined in the ENVIRONMENT and others are defined in make's database.

# compiler flags
# -Wall -Werror -Wextra -O0 -pedantic -DDEBUG for debug build
# -Weverything: Display all warnings
# -Wall       : Enable all common warnings to catch potential issues
# -Wextra     : Enable extra warnings for stricter code checking
# -Werror     : Treat warnings as errors
# -std=c99    : Enforce C99 standard compliance
# -O0         : No optimization (useful for debugging)
# -O1         : Optimize for size and speed with minimal transformations
# -O2         : Optimize more aggressively while maintaining stability
# -O3         : Enable maximum optimization, including aggressive inlining
# -Os         : Optimize for smallest binary size
# -Og         : Optimize while preserving debugging information
# -march=native: Optimize code for the current machine architecture
# -fPIC       : Generate position-independent code (for shared libraries)
# -fstack-protector-strong : Adds stack protection against buffer overflows
# -g          : Include debugging symbols
# -DNDEBUG    : Disable assertions
# -fno-strict-aliasing : Prevents strict aliasing optimizations
